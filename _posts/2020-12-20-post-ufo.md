<p>JavaScript is a well-established coding language that was designed to enhance HTML. It's the backbone of many popular visualization libraries, such as Plotly, and is often used to create custom dashboards. JavaScript also provides
a high level of customization: the dashboards built to deliver visual data, such as maps or graphs, can be as simple or complex as needed.</p>
