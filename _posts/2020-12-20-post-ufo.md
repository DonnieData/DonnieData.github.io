<p><b>JavaScript</b> is a well-established coding language that was originally designed to enhance HTML. It's the backbone of many popular visualization libraries, used with Python such as Plotly, and is often used to create custom dashboards. JavaScript also provides a high level of customization: the dashboards built to deliver visual data, such as maps or graphs, can be as simple or complex as needed.</p>

It is now clear the broad area of uses Javascript can be applied to. However that leads us to a more foccused question, when concerning Data Analytics & Visualization. 

> How can I use Javascript to enhance the data analysis process? 

In order to answer this question, I will be going over how ow to build a simple and customizable [Web Application]() which will allow us to <b>dynamically share data that is filterable based on user-end input using Javascript and HTML.</b> 

As aforemention, Javascript and HTML go hand-in-hand, becuase this, there are many tools at our disposal when working with HTML, namely the javasript library [D3.Js]().
D3 offers many methods that will allow our javascript to communicate with our html web page, in the form of [selections]() which are essentially additonal snippets of code that are inserted within our javascript script. 

## Reosurces 

Including the D3, reosurces needed to create our web application are : 
  - a code editor (with javascript and html packages) 
  - D3.js 
  - HTML
  - Javascript 
  - CSS & 
  - Bootstrap 
 

Thecomponents of this simple Web application frame-work are:
- <b>app.js</b><br> 
This will serve as the core of the application, in which our javascript code will be stored and run from. 
-<b>D3 library </b><br>
This will create a bridge between our webpage and javascript code. Allowing our application to [listen] for user input.
- <b>index.html</b><br>
Our index file will define the structure of our webpage when accessed via a web browser. 
- <b>data.js</b><br> 
In order to have data readyly available for testing and parsing, I have sample data(on UFO sightings) in [JSON]() format for easy parsing.
- <b> CSS & Bootstrap</b> <br>
These will help with the the design and responsive of the webpage components. 



# Building The Application 
With the main focus of this aplication and project is to share data, I will focus on the construction of the the table that will diplay the data as well as the form that will allow user input. 

## Data
Our data is in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format, which is an array of "objects" containg key-value pairs. Each object of the array contains the same "keys" with different "values" which is our ufo sighting data. Becuase each object is the same "shape" and shares the same keys, it will be easy to transform and display the data into a tabular format.

## HTML 

### Table
The html code acts as the skelton and structure of the webpage. With html we can easily create a website template that is viewable within a broswer (example).
The following html code will create a simple webpage with an aprorialty coded table with columns that match the structure of my sample UFO data. 

{% highlight html %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<head>
    <style>
        table, th, td {
          border: 1px solid black;
        }
        </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div >
        <table >
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Date</th>
                <th>City</th>
                <th>State</th>
                <th>Country</th>
                <th>Shape</th>
                <th>Duration</th>
                <th>Comments</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>2011</td>
                    <td>New York City</td>
                    <td>New York</td>
                    <td>US</td>
                    <td>cirlce</td>
                    <td>40 seconds</td>
                    <td>This is my sample table.</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

**Note:** This example includes a sample row of data. However the actual body of the table(<tbody></tbody>) will be left empty since the script will input the data a itself.

### Form
Since we want our data to be filterable based on user input, we will need an HTML component that allows this. Thankfully in HTML we are able to create custom forms!
With the code below, we can add our form anywhere on the page that we please. For now I will place the form arbitrarily and focus on design when applying CSS.

{% highlight html %}
<div id="form-div">
    <form >
        <ul >
            <h5>Filter Search</h5>
            <li >
                <label for="date">Enter a Date</label>
                <input type="text" placeholder="1/10/2010" id="datetime" />
            </li>
            <li>
                <label for="city">Enter a City</label>
                <input type="text" placeholder="san diego" id="city" />
            </li>
            <li>
                <label for="state">Enter a State</label>
                <input type="text" placeholder="ca" id="state" />
            </li>
            <li >
                <label for="country">Enter a Country</label>
                <input type="text" placeholder="us" id="country" />
            </li>
            <li>
                <label for="shape">Enter a Shape</label>
                <input type="text" placeholder="triangle" id="shape" />
            </li>                        
        </ul>
    </form>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

> Note: 

With our table and form coded into our webpage, we now have the 2 essential elements necessary for our application to work smoothly. 
It is important to note the <b>id's</b> used in the input tags, nested within the forms. These id's and tags as well as tags from our table will be used with D3 and javascript to recieve user input and display the matching data. 


- other scripts 


## JavaScript, D3.js
In order for us to create a script of what we need the script we need, we first need to review what we need more granularly. 

What we need our script to do: 
> 1.display all of our data within the table 
> 2.filter the data based on user input 

In order for our code to work as expected and as smoothly as possible, we can furhter break down these segments with even more detail: 

> <b>1.display data</b>
  > a. import and parse data 
  > b. insert data into table to be displayed
>
> <b>2.retrieve input and create filters</b>
  > a. check web page for user input 
  > b. store user input as Javascript objects, to be used as filters  
>
> <b>3.filter data</b>
  > a. use filters as a criteria to remove table rows that do not match the criteria
  > b. insert filtered data into table to be dispalyed 
 
## The Script 
With an understanding of what and how exactly we need our scriptto perform, we can then create aour javascript code to our specifications with the additon of the D3 library selectors where needed. 

{% highlight javascript %}
// from data.js
const tableData = data;

// get table references
var tbody = d3.select("tbody");

function buildTable(data) {
  // First, clear out any existing data
  tbody.html("");
  // Next, loop through each object in the data
  // and append a row and cells for each value in the row
  data.forEach((dataRow) => {
    // Append a row to the table body
    let row = tbody.append("tr");
    // Loop through each field in the dataRow and add
    // each value as a table cell (td)
    Object.values(dataRow).forEach((val) => {
      let cell = row.append("td");
      cell.text(val);
    });
  });
}


// Create a variable to keep track of all the filters as an object.
var filters = {};

// Use this function to update the filters. 
function updateFilters() {
    // Save the element that was changed as a variable.
    let elementInput = d3.select(this);
    // Save the value that was changed as a variable.
    let elementValue = elementInput.property("value");
    // Save the id of the filter that was changed as a variable.
    let elementId = elementInput.attr("id");
    // If a filter value was entered then add that filterId and value
    // to the filters list. Otherwise, clear that filter from the filters object.
    if (elementValue) {
      filters[elementId] = elementValue;
    } 
    else {
      delete filters[elementId];
    }
    // Call function to apply all filters and rebuild the table
    filterTable();
  }


  // Use this function to filter the table when data is entered.
  function filterTable() {
    // Set the filtered data to the tableData.
    let filteredData = tableData;
    // Loop through all of the filters and keep any data that
    // matches the filter values
    for (var keys in filters) {
      filteredData = filteredData.filter(row => row[keys] === filters[keys])
    }
    //rebuild the table using the filtered data
    buildTable(filteredData);
  }
  
  
  // Attach an event to listen for changes to each filter
  d3.selectAll("input").on("change",updateFilters);
  
  // Build the table when the page loads
  buildTable(tableData);

{% endhighlight %}

With this script we are able to address all the needed steps for the application to work proerly. 
While at first glance the script can seem quite hefty, it is predominanlty 3 digestable functions.<br>
Additionally the D3 library allows the functonality needed for our scripts to execute properly. Without using D3 we would have to use very verbose methods, ultimately leading to less manageable code. 

### D3.js
> <small>"D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG, and CSS." , [d3js.org](https://d3js.org/)</small>

Thanks to the D3.js library, we are able to interact with the webpage(HTML code) through its sleectors. These selectors are lynchpins in our script and are referenced several times. 

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Selector / Code Snippet</th>
  <th>Purpose </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td><i>var tbody = d3.select("tbody")</i></td>
  <td> selects hmtl table and assigns table reference as a javascript object </td>
</tr>
  <tr>
    <td><i>d3.selectAll("input").on("change",updateFilters)</i></td>
  <td>detects input when there is a "change" within the webpage form area </td>
</tr>
  <tr>
    <td><i>d3.select(this)</i></td>
  <td>selects and initiates array of inputs from webpage webpage</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<br/>
<b>Building the table</b><br> 
After importing the data (app knows the directory to look into) and assinging it to a variable within our global scope, the buildTable function parses the data 
and transforms the data which is in json format. Each nested object (data value) within the data array is wrapped in the appropriate html tags ("tr",'td") to enable the approrioate rendering within the web page table.

<b>update Filters</b><br>
After our buildtable function we declare an empty array <i>filters</i> which will be used to store our filter values. 
The following function uses a d3 selector to select and initiate an array of user input values as a key,value pair based on the "id" of the input area". 
The "key" being the "id" of the input tag, and the "value" being what is entered within the input area (pictured below). The array of these pairs are then saved within our filter variable. 

Ex: 
[html_id]()
[html_form_input]()


<b>Filtering the Table</b><br>
Our third function filters the table by matching the values of our filters array with the rows of our imported data. The filtered data is then parsed by the buildtable function, effectivly displaying a new (and fitlerred) table within the webpage. 
This process is acheivable with a simple for loop becuase our table is structured to match the keys of our data.

###Structure and Functionality 
With our Javascript code ready and html template set up, we are close to being able to test out our web application. 
However we first need to make sure our files are ready to communicate with other. 

First we need to make sure our files are appropriaelty nested and filed within the correct directories. to maintain organization its is import to maintain a comprehensible framework and strcutre. In the scenario in which I want to make updates in the future, it wil lbe quite easy for me to scale my application with little confusion.

Web Application frame work:

<ul> 
  <li> Test Application Folder </li>
     <ul>
       <li>index.html</li>
       <li> static folder 
        <ul> 
          <li>css Folder </li>
          <li> images folder </li>
          <li> js foler 
              <ul>
               <li>app.js</li>
               <li>data.js</li>
            </ul>

<br/>

> <i><small> Note: file locations and organization is extremly important. When changing the location of files (eg. data.js, app.js) please make sure to update code within within Javascript and hmtl that points to where they are. </small></i>

<br/>
We also need to add our file locations to our html webpage. The file locations should reflect the framework of the application and its relative locations to index.html.
Additonally we need to add the D3.js CDN((Content Delivery Network) link to ur webpage 

<br/>
Add the following html code within the body at the end of your webpage: 
{% highlight html %}
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/d3/4.11.0/d3.js"></script>
    <script src="static/js/data.js"></script>
    <script src="static/js/app.js"></script>
{% endhighlight %}

<br/>

<p> Adding the link to D3.js allows the library to "listen" in on our code, or react to user input. For example, if we did not add this link, our d3.select section of code in app.js wouldn't know where to insert data. <br>
Link rerference: [cdnpkg.com/d3](https://www.cdnpkg.com/d3) <br> 
[More on CDNs](https://www.imperva.com/learn/performance/what-is-cdn-how-it-works/){: .notice--info}</p>

Finally we can test our Application and its functionality. Upon opening the index.html file in our web broswer, we can see that all of our data has been inserted into the once blank table. <br/>
