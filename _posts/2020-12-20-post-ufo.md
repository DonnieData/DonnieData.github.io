<p><b>JavaScript</b> is a well-established coding language that was originally designed to enhance HTML. It's the backbone of many popular visualization libraries, used with Python such as Plotly, and is often used to create custom dashboards. JavaScript also provides a high level of customization: the dashboards built to deliver visual data, such as maps or graphs, can be as simple or complex as needed.</p>

It is now clear the broad area of uses Javascript can be applied to. However that leads us to a more foccused question, when concerning Data Analytics & Visualization. 

> How can I use Javascript to enhance the data analysis process? 

In order to answer this question, I will be going over how ow to build a simple and customizable [Web Application]() which will allow us to <b>dynamically share data that is filterable based on user-end input using Javascript and HTML.</b> 

As aforemention, Javascript and HTML go hand-in-hand, becuase this, there are many tools at our disposal when working with HTML, namely the javasript library [D3.Js]().
D3 offers many methods that will allow our javascript to communicate with our html web page, in the form of [selections]() which are essentially additonal snippets of code that are inserted within our javascript script. 

## Reosurces 

Including the D3, reosurces needed to create our web application are : 
  - a code editor (with javascript and html packages) 
  - D3.js 
  - HTML
  - Javascript 
  - CSS & 
  - Bootstrap 
 

Thecomponents of this simple Web application frame-work are:
- <b>app.js</b><br> 
This will serve as the core of the application, in which our javascript code will be stored and run from. 
-<b>D3 library </b><br>
This will create a bridge between our webpage and javascript code. Allowing our application to [listen] for user input.
- <b>index.html</b><br>
Our index file will define the structure of our webpage when accessed via a web browser. 
- <b>data.js</b><br> 
In order to have data readyly available for testing and parsing, I have sample data(on UFO sightings) in [JSON]() format for easy parsing.
- <b> CSS & Bootstrap</b> <br>
These will help with the the design and responsive of the webpage components. 



# Building The Application 
With the main focus of this aplication and project is to share data, I will focus on the construction of the the table that will diplay the data as well as the form that will allow user input. 

## Data


## HTML 

### Table
The html code acts as the skelton and structure of the webpage. With html we can easily create a website template that is viewable within a broswer (example).
The following html code will create a simple webpage with an aprorialty coded table with columns that match the structure of my sample UFO data. 

{% highlight html %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<head>
    <style>
        table, th, td {
          border: 1px solid black;
        }
        </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div >
        <table >
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Date</th>
                <th>City</th>
                <th>State</th>
                <th>Country</th>
                <th>Shape</th>
                <th>Duration</th>
                <th>Comments</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>2011</td>
                    <td>New York City</td>
                    <td>New York</td>
                    <td>US</td>
                    <td>cirlce</td>
                    <td>40 seconds</td>
                    <td>This is my sample table.</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

> Note: This example includes a sample row of data. However the actual body of the table(<tbody></tbody>) will not be hard coded with data since the script will input the dat a itself.

### Form
Since we want our data to be filterable based on user input, we will need an HTML component that allows this. Thankfully in HTML we are able to create custom forms!
With the code below, we can add our form anywhere on the page that we please. For now I will place the form arbitrarily and focus on design when applying CSS.

{% highlight html %}
<div id="form-div">
    <form >
        <ul >
            <h5>Filter Search</h5>
            <li >
                <label for="date">Enter a Date</label>
                <input type="text" placeholder="1/10/2010" id="datetime" />
            </li>
            <li>
                <label for="city">Enter a City</label>
                <input type="text" placeholder="san diego" id="city" />
            </li>
            <li>
                <label for="state">Enter a State</label>
                <input type="text" placeholder="ca" id="state" />
            </li>
            <li >
                <label for="country">Enter a Country</label>
                <input type="text" placeholder="us" id="country" />
            </li>
            <li>
                <label for="shape">Enter a Shape</label>
                <input type="text" placeholder="triangle" id="shape" />
            </li>                        
        </ul>
    </form>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

> Note: 

With our table and form coded into our webpage, we now have the 2 essential elements necessary for our application to work smoothly. 
It is important to note the <b>id's</b> used in the input tags, nested within the forms. These id's and tags as well as tags from our table will be used with D3 and javascript to recieve user input and display the matching data. 


- other scripts 


## JavaScript

In order for us to create a script of what we need the script we need, we first need to review what we need more granularly. 

What we need our script to do: 

1.display all of our data within the table 
2.filter the data based on user input 

In order for our code to work as expected and as smoothly as possible, we can furhter break down these segments with even more detail: 

1a. import and parse data 
1b. insert data into table to be displayed

2a. check web page for user input 
2b. store user input as Javascript objects, to be used as filters 
2c. use filters as a criteria to remove table rows that do not match the criteria 
2d. insert filtered data into table to be dispalyed
