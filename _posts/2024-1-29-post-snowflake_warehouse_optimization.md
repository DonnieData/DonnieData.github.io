### Project Overview 
- cost optimization

With the advent of cloud computing and its related services such as cloud storage. data lifecyle ecosystems are going thorugh a big change. One common overhall hapening within companys due to this is going from onsite database and storage to cloud-based. With this comes a need for data related teams to have a better operational understanding. 
A new concept is cloud pricing models and credit consumption. 

This project will focus on optimizing for query cost in Snowflake - a popular Software as a Service(SaaS) for cloud data services and tools. 

### Snowflake - Warehouses & Structure 

As a quick overview...
Snowflake operates in 3 layers that interact with each other: 
- Storage Layer - Where data is stored
-  Compute Layer -  Query handling, security, metadata, cloud compute services 
-  Cloud Services Layer - 


x is where warehouses are, y is where compute is 


### Snowflake 
- test query
- setting up warehouses
- review query result stats 

### Testing Query performaance
- execute in warehouses collect result data 


### Cost & Performance Analysis 
- analyze
