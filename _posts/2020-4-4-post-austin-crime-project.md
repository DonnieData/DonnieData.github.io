# Project Overview 
Spending time in Austin and getting a lay of the land brought about curiousity on city data and statistics. Coupled with a desire to channel creativity and my love for working with data - this project came about.

I found a public database that held several years of police reports filed with Austin Police Department. 
in an effort to challenge myself with working with this data -- I developed a web applciation from scratch TO decimate the data in a way I saw fit, impactful and also fun!


# Steps 
This detailed and extensive project involved many steps in the data life cycle from start to finish.These can be summarized by the major Phases below:
