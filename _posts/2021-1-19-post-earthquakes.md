<GeoJson> is a widely-used data format for displaying geographical data in web maps and applications. GeoJson consits of <i>Geometry Object</i> can can contain a plethora of information including, the type of object being mapped including single markers on the map or even lines. As well as location names, longitude, latitude and even timestamps!
  
With the flexibilty to easily be parsed and transformed, it is no wonder GeoJson is the industry standard when it comes to making map visualizations. In order to explore and  GeoJson myself, I have created a web application to visualize Earthquake GeoJson data.


## Application Overview 
The earthquake data is retrieved 

Overiew: 


Api 

Layered with Leaflet and mapbox it is a powerful visualization. 
  
  It is based on JavaScript object notation(JSON), a simple and minimalist format for expressing data structures using syntax from JavaScript.

GeoJSON data consists of a single object, which can be represented by a geometry object, features object, or collection of features. 

What is Leaflet?

Leaflet is an extremely popular, open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps. It helps us display and visualize data in ways that are user-friendly and meaningful for data analysts and nonexperts alike.

WSome things you can do with leaflet:

Geojson points, multipolygon as a leaflet vector etc.

GeoJSON is an open standard format, which is essentially a type of JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) for representing geographical features along with their nonspatial attributes. It is commonly used with libraries like Leaflet.js.
