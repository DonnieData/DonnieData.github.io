<b>Data</b> is everywhere and most company's have systems to store and analyze data. However there will always be additional contex that can be provided when applying external data, this is especially the case with Data Analysis.
With cities such as Austin having robust databases with a plethora of public datasets (some updated daily), I feel a great data engineering tool would be one that streamlines API requests. 
A simple application that can be quicly ran and automate the querying(get request) of data, formating, and saving can save anyone working with public databases time.
