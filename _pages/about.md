I have always had a great desire to gain a deeper understanding of the computer science industry and its respective fields. This desire only grew throughout my professional career as I became exposed to more and more analytical tools ranging from marketing and communication focussed to database tools.

My ambitions led me to delve further into data analytics which began with self-learning the basics of my first high-level programming language, python.
In order to gain more in-depth analytical skills and the necessary exposure to data analytics, I earned my certificate in Data Analytics from The University of Texas. Through this rigorous course I have been able to fortify my programming skills with computer languages including python, SQL, and HTML.
